## Data science

Emerging (and highly-paid) field that includes: 

* Data exploration, preparation, and visualization

* Statistical modeling and machine learning

* Software development and engineering

* Practical business and/or domain expertise

## Wins above replacement (WAR)

* Composite metric that measures __the number of additional wins a player is worth__ relative to an average player at that position

* [2019 WAR data: ESPN.com](http://www.espn.com/mlb/war/leaders)

---

## Weighted on-base average (wOBA)

* Batting average: how frequently a batter gets a hit

* On-base percentage (OBP): how often a batter reaches base

* wOBA: different weights applied to different on-base appearances based on _value_

---

## Defense-independent pitching statistics (DIPS)

* __Earned run average__ (ERA): earned runs per nine innings pitched

* __DIPS__: focus on statistics _specific to the pitcher_

* Example: fielding-independent pitching (FIP)

## The landscape of baseball analytics

Theo Epstein ([source](http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-spt-cubs-theo-epstein-analytics-20180327-story.html)): 

> There's no doubt the landscape is a lot flatter now... Most organizations are operating basically with the same data streams, same numbers.

> So if everyone has the same information, you want to put a premium on a humanistic approach understanding people... Putting them in a position to succeed and supporting them as human beings and individuals and the chemistry of the group as a whole.

## Probability and statistics

---

## Probability

* **Probability**: the likelihood of the occurrence of an event

* **Statistical significance**: the probability that an observation/effect is not the result of random chance
---

## Frequentist statistics

* What is the mathematical relationship between an outcome variable $Y$ and one or more other "predictor" variables $X_{1}...X_{n}$?

The linear model: 

$$ Y = Xb + e $$

where $Y$ represents the outcome variable, $X$ is a matrix of predictors, $b$ represents the "parameters", and $e$ represents the errors, or "residuals"

---

## The normal distribution

```{r simple-plot, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

set.seed(1234)
df <- data.frame(cond = factor( rep(c("A","B"), each=200) ), 
                   values = c(rnorm(200),rnorm(200, mean=.8)))

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x=values)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),      # Histogram with density instead of count on y-axis
                   binwidth=.5,
                   colour="black", fill="white") +
    geom_density(alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666")

```

---

## Bayesian statistics

* Given our _prior beliefs_ about a mathematical relationship, what is the probability of an event occurring?

## Machine learning and predictive modeling

* The use of statistical modeling to _make predictions_ about future behavior
